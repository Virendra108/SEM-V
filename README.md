# SEM V Subjects Repository

This repository contains code and lab work for the SEM V subjects, organized into three main folders: `CN_Lab`, `DAAL`, and `WT`. The code files are focused on logic-related tasks, with some content related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). WT related to web technology.

## Folder Structure

- **CN_Lab**: Contains code files related to Computer Networks.
  - **Hamming Code**: Implementation of the Hamming code algorithm used for error detection and correction.

- **DAAL**: Contains DSA related codes and lab assignments.
  - **Part A**:
    - **binarysearch.java**: Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
    - **facttrailxzero.java**: Code to find trailing zeros in a factorial of a number.
    - **movezeros.java**: Algorithm to move all zeros in an array to the end, maintaining the order of other elements.
    - **numberofzeros.java**: Code to count the number of zeros in an array or list.
  
  - **Part B**:
    - **maxshop.java**: Code to solve a problem related to visiting the maximum number of shops within given constraints.
    - **stock.java**: Implementation of an algorithm to maximize profit by trading stocks based on daily rates.
  
  - **Part C**:
    - **SubsetSum.java**: Checks if there is a subset of the given set whose sum is equal to the given sum using dynamic programming.
    - **StringTransformation.java**: Determines if it's possible to transform one string to another by converting some lowercase letters to uppercase and deleting others.
    - **Coin_change.java**: Finds the number of ways to make a given sum by using different combinations of coins.

  - **Part D**:
    - **BitMask_Subset.java**: Finds all distinct subsets of a given set using the Bit Masking approach.
    - **Subset_byBackTracking.java**: Prints all subsets of a given set using backtracking.

- **WT**: (Details to be added later as the folder is currently empty or under development.)

## Usage

Each folder contains specific code files related to its subject area. The codes are written in Java and are focused on solving algorithmic problems that are often encountered in technical interviews and exams.

### Running the Code

To run the Java files:
1. Navigate to the folder containing the code file in your terminal.
2. Compile the code using the following command:<br>
  javac filename.java
3. Run the compiled code:<br>
  java filename
